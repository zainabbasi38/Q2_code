            "*   **Reason:**  This is about using the learned information to solve problems, make decisions, and draw conclusions. For example, an AI playing chess needs to reason about possible moves.\n",
            "*   **Perceive:** This is the ability to take in information from the world through senses like vision (image recognition), hearing (speech recognition), or touch (robotics).\n",
            "*   **Problem-solve:** This is the ability to find solutions to new or complex situations, not just repeating pre-programmed tasks.\n",

            "    *   **Reinforcement learning:** The AI learns by trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones (e.g., an AI learning to play a game).\n",
            "*   **Deep Learning (DL):** This is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data. This is what powers a lot of the recent advances in image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas.\n",
            "*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This deals with how computers understand and process human language. It is used in chatbots, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.\n",
            "*   **Computer Vision:** This focuses on enabling computers to \"see\" and understand images and videos. It is used in facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Front-End Development:** This focuses on what users see and interact with directly. It involves building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Key technologies include:\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** This is the foundation of every webpage. It provides the structure and content of the page, using tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.\n",
            "    *   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** This is used to style and format the HTML content. It controls the visual appearance of the page, including colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness.\n",
            "    *   **JavaScript:** This is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can handle user interactions, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and make requests to servers.\n",
